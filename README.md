# pokemon-game
This is an object oriented pokemon game, where you can choose two pokemons(Bisasam or Shiggy) which can fight against another pokemon.(Glumanda)
After each fight, the winning pokemons level is updated. Every Pokemon has differrent attributes(weaknesses,strenghts,health,attackskills etc.), which play a role in the fight.
If one chooses the wrong pokemon at the beginning of the program, a exception is thrown.
The Program contains the concepts of inheritance, works with a enum and constants. An abstract class is also used.
